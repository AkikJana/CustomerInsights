coapt : we discussed with our hf team they think if 30d no change and still symptomatic doubt 3m will improve enough not to do anything unless they need to titrate their gdmt again. our pts are on max gdmt already 30d after hf eval. message is refer early and hf rec #teer don t argue! .####[([0],[2, 8, 15, 20],'NEU')]
so you are saying that if the mr isn t better at 30 days, then it won t be better at 3 months? i have not seen COAPT data on this either way. .####[([27],[24, 25, 26],'NEU')]
if you want 3m it s too late. we reeval in 30d. coapt was too strict imo. we see pts don t last 3m and lose compliance. .####[([12],[6, 14, 15],'NEU')]

The AACR 2022 presentation of CM-816 study brought attention to the TL by the pCR rate and impressive HR 0.13. The CM-816 will be definitely a practice change in Early Disease, according to her .####[([5, 21],[3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18, 32],'POS')]
TL at a large community research site stated that although they do very little surgery at his institution, the EFS data from CM-816 is compelling and he asked for the AACR 2022 and ASCO 2021 data presentations to share with the lung disease oriented group (including surgeons) at his site and other satellite sites. He noted that he would follow-up with their thoughts on the approach .####[([22],[3, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 35],'NEU')]
CORE-1: NTL Dr. Uchio responded to question about pharmacodynamic endpoint markers to indicate combinatorial effect on the immune system between the two agents. Speaker noted that this would be the holy grail, but if we observe the more clinical/translational, even with PD1 markers we still treating patients without markers available, and they continue to respond. So in the case of patients who are trying to save their bladder, it seems treatment without biomarker is justified .####[([0],[4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14],'NEU')]
During the CODEBREAK-100 discussant, the TL stated that though KRAS inhibitors has made major advances, the overall effectiveness of KRAS inhibitors may be limited to patient factors, intrinsic biology and complex resistance mechanisms .####[([2],[3, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23],'NEU')]
During the discussant of CODEBREAK-100, the TL asked the question if we can give KRAS safely with IO therapy. He believes we can and sees a potential where we are combining the two agents. For example, he thinks we can give Neo-adj therapy with nivo+chemo followed by surgery and then a KRAS inhibitor or combine KN189 with a KRAS inhibitor. He does not see additional toxicities or other reasons not to combine therapy. He does agree that additional trials are warranted. .####[([4],[7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 38, 39, 40, 48],'NEU')]
During the CODEBREAK-100 discussant presentation the TL stated that he would prioritize PDL1 therapy over KRAS therapy if the patient had high PDL1 therapy, high TMB, high TILs, and wild type STK11/KEAP1. .####[([2],[3, 4],'NEU')]
AACR22: NTL Dr. de Bono emphasized that even though the pretreated mCRPC patients with a high correlation with gL OH-High status correlated with an improved response to talazoparib, the lower N and preselection of patients based on HRR11 could limit the interpretations of evident 'POS' responses. .####[([27],[5, 21, 24, 25],'POS')]
AACR22: Additional questions surrounding the use of adjuvant treatment for patients from CM-816 and would that have additional benefit in patients even those with pCR  .####[([12],[1, 14, 16, 17, 18],'NEU')]
During the Q/A session, there was a question on what could be driving the differences in EFS based geography for CM-816 trial.  Asia appeared to do better than Europe and NA.  TL highlighted that geography was not a stratification factor and that several factors such as patient selection and type of surgery could play a role. .####[([20],[7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 52],'NEU')]
TL thinks for CM-816 combining IO with is the new SOC and will almost certainly improve OS in early-stage disease.  He added that neoadjuvant IO has a multiple theoretical advantages over adjuvant .####[([3],[14, 15],'POS')]
NTL commented on the lack of guidance on what to do in patients who did not achieve a pCR.  He pro'POS'ed a trial to be run through ECOG where patients from CM816 regimen will be randomized to nivo/chemo or observation. .####[([31],[12, 29, 30],'NEU'), ([37],[35, 39],'NEU')]
NTL highlighted the CM-816 EFS benefit in PDL1 'POS' there was a difference of 25% at years 2 and 3.  NTL highlighted the data was being clinical significant. .####[([3],[1, 5, 21, 23, 26, 27],'POS')]
Prominent lung TL, I really think that the 816 trial readout was the best of #AACR22 and while pembro was looking good for a while, this really brings nivo back to the forefront of peoples minds .####[([8],[10, 13],'POS'), ([18],[20, 21],'NEU'), ([28],[27, 29, 32],'POS')]
TL commented that the cm-816 data showed a very solid HR and was very reassuring. TL mentioned that their current SOC for stage 3 As outside of trials is upfront Sx followed by adjuvant where the EFS would have looked different however (at 5 Yrs. adjuvant there is only 10-12% benefit) so this data so definitely shifting that curve despite still having to mature more. .####[([4],[6, 8, 9, 13, 14],'POS')]
TL commented that EFS is definitely a surrogate for OS at the moment and has to be a surrogate for all neoadjuvant trials like cm-816. It is not practical for it not to be in Neoadjuvant settings as you cannot wait always for OS to come through. It takes a long time and the field changes whilst you wait. .####[([24],[5, 7, 10, 12, 18],'NEU')]
NTL shared that he prefers CM-816 survivals as a metric of success over median OS especially IO therapy because of the MOA of these agents .####[([5],[6, 11],'POS')]
Despite OS not reaching significance, NTL highlighted the fact that the difference in OS between patients on Nivochemo at 24 months was 12% and that this is clinically meaningful. .####[([17],[27, 28],'POS')]
AACR22: During CT012 presentation of the CM816 EFS data, NTL stated that EFS was consistently improved across the majority of subgroups even though it was not powered to detect differences. In regard to EFS by stage, he noted that in patients with stage Ib-II disease these data are not mature enough to see the full benefit yet as these patients have a better prognosis- longer follow up may show additional benefit of nivo + chemo in this subgroup. .####[([6],[14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22],'POS')]
Neoadjuvant ICI, AACR22: NTL began review of neoadjuvant presentation by showing remarkable benefit of just brief ex'POS'ure to anti-PD1 on depth of path response with nivo mono (Forde et al) or atezo mono (LCMC3), emphasizing 3-yr OS ~80% similar from LCMC3 and NADIM trials in stage III patients - more than doubling prior expectations, pointing out no adjuvant IO was provided. Very impressive .####[([42],[38, 39],'NEU')]
CM816, AACR22: NTL from the podium emphasizes that thoracic surgery is not good psychotherapy and we need to change the mindset with surgeons and patients regarding that actual medical urgency vs a psychological urgency to operate immediately in resectable patients .####[([0],[3, 5, 16, 18],'NEU')]
Biomarkers in perioperative setting NSCLC, AACR22 - NTL from podium commenting on ctDNA analysis from IMPOWER010 indicating that benefit magnitude of adjuvant atezo better in high risk patients, however sensitivity is remains an issue.

PACIFIC, AACR22: NTL discussing from the podium - need to validate whether timing matters (between CRT/RT and ICI), noting trend for benefit in analysis of patients who started durva within 14 days of CRT - is there a locally inflamed environment that is priming the immune system? .####[([0],[3, 4, 6],'NEU'), ([28],[35, 38, 39, 42, 43],'NEU')]
IMPOWER010, AACR22: NTL said that DFS and OS KM curves hint significant OS improvement will be achieved, but highlights subgroup data of PD-L1 ≥ 50% driving most benefit, lack of benefit in driver mutations so still important to perform genomic testing early, despite doubt that TKIs will are curative in any setting (as op'POS'ed to IO) .####[([0],[10, 11, 16, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 29],'POS')]
While discussing CM816 data from AACR with a community oncologist with a  limited contact with thoracic surgeons TL commented about this being intriguing data but main question is the control arm for this study is not typical standard of care (at least in the respective region). So, TL thought there might be some issues around practical implementation and was wondering whether the value remains unclear. .####[([2],[53, 55, 64],'NEG')]
CM-816 : 	• 2y OS of 83% is promising	• HR is on track	• Taken together, the data is practice changing	• He expected 30% OS benefit and what this data is showing is around 40%	• Looks likes starting to plateau .####[([0],[6, 16, 17, 19, 28],'POS')]
An academic community medical oncologist very experienced with IO across different indications was very impressed with CM-816 data presented at AACR.

An academic community medical oncologist very experienced with IO across different indications was very impressed with CM-816 data presented at AACR. TL was surprised that majority of the patients in CM-816 were stage IIIA and mentioned at their institution majority of stage IIIA get delineated by PET imaging at and are typically unresectable and sent for Chemo-RT followed by consolidated Durvalumab.

AACR 2022.  Iovance Representative told me that this company has been discussing utilizing their Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) manufacturing process in NSCLC in either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.  Since the process requires >1.5 cm tumor to make the TIL, the resected tumor is either going to Pathology or dis'POS'al and this would be an ideal time to collect the necessary tissue.  The Rep stated the TL at MSK have a feeling, without supporting data, that the TIL collected after priming with CM-816 would be superior than TIL infused in the adjuvant setting .####[([82],[85, 86],'POS')]

Respiratory physicians need to see this data because when they upstage a patient after EBUS to stage IIIA, they need to send them back to the surgeon.Rad oncs need to see this data so that operable IIIA can get CM-816 and surgery rather than PACIFIC. .####[([39],[35, 37, 38],'POS'), ([44],[42, 43],'NEG')]
CM-816 : During a remote interaction, TL has mentioned about the recent publication at NEJM and presentation at AACR 2022. TL think that this is 'POS'sibly practice changing but the interim overall survival analysis did not cross statistical significance. It is still important to look at OS follow up and subgroup analysis. He thinks that it is important to increase awareness among surgeons and chest physicians .####[([0],[25, 26, 59],'NEU')]
When discussing CM-816 data from AACR TL compared the results from this study with the 2 adjuvant trials.  TL believes that adjuvant IO would be needed but for now, we do not know who should receive it as the 2 adjuvant trials showed a different subgroup of patients who benefited from adjuvant IO.  The Roche trial was mainly the PDL-1 high while the Merck trial is the PDL-1 <50%. The med onc mentioned that most international TLs are still puzzled and cant explain the differences in these results .####[([2],[79, 81, 82],'NEU')]

Reaction to CM-816 presentation at AACR :TL finds the difference very impressive for stage IIIA. TL is awainting to see if LT data will show the same thing for stage IB-II, but there is a question on risk vs benefice in this second population. TL finds the difference in EFS for PD-L1 < 1% is a reminder of the IMpower010 data for this subgroup.  TL finds this population to continue to be an unmet medical need.  TL noticed for the 1st time seeing a better benefit for non-smokers, consider it being a small subgroup and think it is probably be a wrong-signal.TL finds the data very exciting and said there will be a lot to be discuss when all IO studies in resectable stage will come to maturity.TL stated that for the moment, the morale is; if resectable, we resect and that IO-CT pré- vs 'POS't- is to be debate.
